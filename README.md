# Space Crusade
This project was created as part of an assignment for a class I took at Arizona State University. A lot of time an effort went into desgning, planning, and learning GameMaker Studio. 

Sorry, for the lag in the gif's, but they should give you a good idea of what the game is like! Hope you like it!
