# Space Crusade
This project was created as part of an assignment for a class I took at Arizona State University. A lot of time an effort went into desgning, planning, and learning GameMaker Studio. 

# Overview
Space Crusade is a shooting simulation game that focuses on objectives to complete certain levels. The game will not only challenge your ability to navigate through various obstacles, but also test your abilities to complete level specific tasks that involve the player to be conscientious of their actions while playing the game as well. The goal depending on the level will increase in difficulty and add either more of a certain task or introduce new tasks that will challenge the player to morph their gameplay style based on the objectives given in each level.

# Story
This game will take place during a time of space exploration to find new worlds to colonize on to further keep the human race alive and in competition with other races. While aboard “The Crusade” one of many ships in a fleet of exploration ships they will stumble across an alien ship damaged from battle or so that is what they thought. The alien ship in reality is luring in other ships to steal their resources and scavenge the ship for parts while at the same time trying to eliminate you and the rest of your crew. In an attempt to save the remaining crew members and prevent the aliens from hijacking their ship “The Crusade” moves into and asteroid field to prevent losing the remaining survivors. The majority of the crew has abandoned ship and now it’s up to the star fighters of “The Crusade” to save the crew and prevent the aliens from destroying the escape pods and other fighter in the fleet.

# Game Play
The player will suit up and launch an attack against the alien fighters to prevent them from destroying the escape pods whilst being aware of the surrounding asteroids that if hit will result in major damage to their ship or immediate death. In each level the player will be piloting different ships in the fleet of star fighters. There will be 3 different levels with 3 different classes of ships that will take place in different parts of the asteroid field. The first level will entail the “Support” division that’s main objective is to save crew members from there escape pods. The second division the “Specialist” division will take care of securing both necessary provisions and supplies whilst also saving crew members. Lastly, the third division the “Elites” will have to escort the high priority members on board a fleet transport from being destroyed and fight off incoming enemies and destroy incoming asteroids from destroying the support ship.
